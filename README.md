# An application simulating a traffic light by Spec and Morph
A simple example of using Spec. To create the application were used:
- SpNumberInputPresenter, SpButtonPresenter, SpMorphPresenter
- custom presenter InputPanelPresenter
- SpGridLayout, SpBoxLayout and combinations of it

The application can work in two modes: in the manual mode user switches lamps one by one by pressing the button,
in the automatic mode a stopwatch helps to switch lamp. A user can define durations of glow of the lamps.
